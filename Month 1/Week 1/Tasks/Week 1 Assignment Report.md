# Week 1 Report

# GitHub and Foundational Linux Command Utilization

## Overview

- GitHub stands as a pivotal infrastructure in modern cybersecurity and software development. Its distributed version control and advanced repository orchestration serve essential functions in code auditing, DevSecOps integration, infrastructure-as-Code management, and collaborative tooling. 
- Proficiency in Git is thus fundamental for Red Team operators and security engineers alike.
- Simultaneously, expertise in Linux command-line operations in indispensable. The terminal is the backbone of most offensive security tasks including reconnaissance, privilege escalation, persistence, and lateral movement.
- An adept understanding of Linux is a prerequisite for any professional working in adversarial simulation or threat emulation.

## Core Git Concepts Practiced

- `git init` -> Repository initialization
- git clone / git pull -> Source code retrieval and synchronization 
- git add / git commit â€“ Staging and versioned tracking of code
- git push â€“ Remote repository update
- git branch / merge â€“ Modular feature development and integration
- git log / blame â€“ Historical code forensics and author attribution

## Linux Command Taxonomy

- Filesystem:  `ls -al`, `cd`, `find`, `file`, `nano`
- System Diagnostics: `uname -a`, `df -h`, `uptime`, `top`, `whoami`
- Access Control: `chmod`, `chown`, `umask`
- Networking: `netstat`, `ss`, `ping`, `nmap`, `curl`, `wget`
- Process Management: `ps`, `kill`, `htop`, `tasklist`, `pkill`
- Scripting & Parsing: `bash`, `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `for`, `if`

# Strategic Role Declaration â€“ Red Team Commitment

Role Selection: Red Team ðŸ”´

### Justification
- Deep-rooted expertise in offensive security paradigms, C2 framework deployment, and post-exploitation scripting
- Demonstrated operational experience via Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and independent bug bounty research
- Proficiency in adversarial simulation and real-world exploit engineering
- Tactical command over lateral movement, credential harvesting, and privilege escalation chains

### Objectives of Engagement
- Payload Weaponization
- Exploit Delivery and Execution
- Initial Compromise and Privilege Escalation
- Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure Management
- Data Exfiltration and Lateral Expansion

# Digital Forensics and OSINT Methodologies

## Digital Forensics Framework
- Digital forensics is central to post-incident investigations, evidentiary reporting, and attack surface reconstruction. The discipline incorporates volatile and non-volatile data acquisition, hash-based verification, temporal sequencing, and environment reconstruction.

### Key Techniques:

- Maintaining forensic integrity through chain of custody
- Disk imaging with hash verification (MD5, SHA-256)
- Timeline reconstruction from file system and registry artifacts
- Memory image parsing for active threat visibility

### Tools Employed:

- [Autopsy](https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/)
- [Volatility](https://volatilityfoundation.org/)
- [FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4-5)
- [NirSoft Suite](https://www.nirsoft.net/)

## OSINT Capabilities

- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) represents the foundation of passive reconnaissance. It enables asset mapping, infrastructure profiling, threat actor analysis, and social engineering context development.

### Tools Utilized:

- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)
- [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot)
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)
- [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/)
- [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng)

### Use Cases:
- Threat actor fingerprinting
- Corporate surface enumeration
- Social engineering intelligence collection

# Advanced Malware Analysis and Threat Attribution

## Malware Analysis Taxonomy
![Taxonomy](image.png)

## Key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Abnormal system calls: `VirtualAlloc`, `CreateRemoteThread`
- Registry-based persistence (`HKCU\...\Run`)
- Outbound connections on non-standard ports (C2 traffic)
- Fileless payloads utilizing PowerShell, WMI, or macros


## In-Depth Interpretation of the Malware Analysis Checklist

- The provided checklist constitutes a comprehensive 58-point analytical model for dissecting malware campaigns.
