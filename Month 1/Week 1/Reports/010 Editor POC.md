# Tool Name: 010 Editor

## History

010 Editor, developed by SweetScape Software, is a professional hex editor and binary analysis tool launched in the early 2000s. It has gained widespread use in digital forensics, malware reverse engineering, and embedded device analysis.

## Description

010 Editor is a commercial-grade hex and text editor designed for inspecting, editing, and scripting binary files, disk images, memory dumps, and structured formats with Binary Templates.


## What Is This Tool About?

It allows cybersecurity professionals to analyze file structures at the byte level, interpret file headers, and locate hidden data or malware stubs. It's a go-to tool for reverse engineering malware payloads, corrupted file recovery, and carving forensic artifacts.

## Key Characteristics / Features

- Binary Templates for format-aware analysis (e.g., PNG, PE, PDF)
- Full scripting engine using proprietary syntax
- Disk editor for raw partition data
- Memory analysis for process snapshots
- Advanced search (regex, pattern, hex)
- Data inspector for decoding types (int, float, unicode)
- Endianness-aware editing
- Unicode and ASCII viewing
- File compare for diffing binary files
- Portable version available
- Bookmarking of offsets and structures
- Script sharing via SweetScape community
- Debugging and validation functions
- Template debugger to walk through parsed formats
- Supports huge files (multi-GB)

## Types / Modules Available

- Binary Template Editor
- Disk Editor
- Memory Inspector
- Scripting Console
- Data Visualizer
- Structure Validator

## How Will This Tool Help?

- Enables reverse engineers to dissect malicious binaries
- Supports low-level forensic carving from raw images
- Useful for analyzing non-standard or custom file formats
- Assists malware analysts in locating C2 addresses, obfuscated payloads
- Validates file structures using templates for evidentiary purposes

## Time to Use / Best Case Scenarios

- During reverse engineering or static malware analysis
- When viewing hex-level data from memory/disk
- During post-exploitation payload decoding

## When to Use During Investigation

- File structure corruption forensics
- Detection of embedded or steganographic payloads
- Analyzing obfuscated file headers or malicious stubs

## Best Person to Use This Tool & Required Skills

- Reverse Engineer, Forensics Analyst
- Needs familiarity with hex, file signatures, binary formats, scripting

## Flaws / Suggestions to Improve
